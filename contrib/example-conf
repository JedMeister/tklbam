# volsize: size of backup volumes in MBs

volsize 25

# s3-parallel-uploads: Amazon S3 supports multipart uploads. This
# allows different chunks of a volume to be uploaded in parallel
# which may increase upload speed.
#
# The minimum chunk size is 5MB so the maximum s3-parallel-uploads value 
# equals volsize / 5

s3-parallel-uploads	1

# full-backup: time frequency of full backup
# (in between full backups we do incremental backups)
#
#   format := <int>[mhDWM]
#     
#     e.g.,
#     60m - 60 minutes
#     12h - 12 hours
#     3D - three days
#     2W - two weeks
#     1M - one month

full-backup 1M

# Skip backup components?

backup-skip-files       False
backup-skip-packages    False
backup-skip-database    False

# restore-cache-size: the maximum size of the download cache in restore-cache-path
# 
# This will come in handy when:
# 1) resuming big restores (already downloaded backup archives don't need to be re-downloaded)
# 2) if you make a mistake and need to rollback the restore and try again
#
# e.g.,
#       1000MB
#       2GB
#       50% - 50% of free space in the restore-cache-path

restore-cache-size 50%
restore-cache-dir /var/cache/tklbam/restore

# dirindex-format: the format to save new dirindex's in
#
#  1 - the old text format, used for a long time this format is stable, but ambigious
#      and some special characters are not treated properly.
#
#  2 - a more precise, unambigious binary format that handles all special
#      characters properly
#
# This will be set to `2` after a new full backup with the latest tklbam (to
# avoid any potentially undefined behaviour trying to convert the old format to
# the new format, it's highly recommended you do not change this setting
# yourself)

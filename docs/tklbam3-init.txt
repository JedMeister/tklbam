SYNOPSIS
========

tklbam3-init [ --force ] [ `API-KEY` ]

By default, this links TKLBAM to your Hub account and downloads an appropriate
backup profile, which is used to calculate the list of system changes we need
to backup. On a TurnKey system the profile describes the installation state of
the appliance and contains a list of packages, filesystem paths to scan for
changes and an index of the contents of those paths which records timestamps,
ownership and permissions. On a non-TurnKey system the default backup profile
will not describe installation state, only a list of directories to backup.

ARGUMENTS
=========

`API-KEY`   Cut and paste this from your Hub account's user profile.

If you do not provide the API-KEY as a command line argument you will be
prompted for it interactively (unless you use the --solo option)

OPTIONS
=======

--force                         Force re-initialization with new API-KEY

--force-profile=PROFILE_ID      Force a specific backup profile 
                                (e.g., "core", "turnkey-core-13.0-wheezy-amd64")

                                Without --force-profile the profile_id is 
                                automatically detected.

--force-profile=empty           "empty" is a special profile_id value that creates an empty
                                backup profile. Backup configurations will only be taken 
                                from /etc/tklbam.

--force-profile=PATH            Path to a custom backup profile

                                Details: tklbam3-internal create-profile --help


--solo                         Solo mode: disables link to Hub.

                               You'll need to --force-profile=empty or use a custom profile

                               tklbam3-backup will only work with --address or --dump options

                               tklbam3-restore will only work with --address or a backup extract

SECURITY WARNING
================

Providing your Hub account's APIKEY as a command line argument is potentially less secure
than allowing tklbam3-init to prompt you for it interactively:

* The shell may save the APIKEY to its history file (e.g., ~/.bash_history)
* The APIKEY may briefly show up in the process list

USAGE EXAMPLES
==============

::

    # initialize TKLBAM
    tklbam3-init

    # initialize TKLBAM with the core profile
    tklbam3-init --force-profile=core

    # initialize TKLBAM with a non-default registry path
    TKLBAM_REGISTRY=/var/lib/tklbam3_2 tklbam3-init

    # initialize TKLBAM in solo mode with an empty profile
    tklbam3-init --solo --force-profile=empty
